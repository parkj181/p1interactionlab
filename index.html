          <p class="intro" alt="introduction">Hi! How are you guys doing? My name is Junyong Park and I am a second year candidate for BFA Communication Design Program at Parsons School of Design. I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea and this is my second year to study in New York City. It has been quite a journey for me as a designer to study in one of the meccas of design industries. My design principle lies heavily on minimalistic approach with simple, yet clear signals to design concept.
